## HOLA

While I'm practicing Shouting Into the Void, I thought it might be useful to develop a framework for a repeating bit-o-blogging that can be summoned regardless of presence/absence of those flighty bastards known as "ideas". Hence: What I'm Reading is born. I plan to screencap my Brave Rewards summary and Analyze my Webbings. 
(I don't have a clear idea yet of how often this list changes appreciably, therefore frequency of updates is TBD.)


ONWARD

1.I've become enamored with The New Yorker. There's just something about a limit on free articles per month, with a tantalizing 2 paragraph tease behind a headline I've already fallen for. OK, many headlines I've already fallen for. New Yorker, you tease. Shut up and take my money.

As an example, (though admittedly discovered a year late): https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/02/12/the-white-darkness

Tell me, who can resist a survival story? Sitting around in my pajamas, drinking my umpteenth cup of coffee for the day, having achieved nothing more taxing than feeding the dogs -- what better setting for a tale of daring, endurance, persistance, the display of that elusive quality of stubborn curiousity that's fed so much of human achievement? *sips coffee* Yeah. That's the stuff.

2.I was lured by the recent [think-pieces](https://www.wired.com/story/soothing-promise-our-own-artisanal-internet/) and/or Twitter [take](https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1082383700602499073) on the rise of newsletters as a counterpoint to the treadmill-effect of attempting to keep up with internet news, and as a result signed up for an absolute glut of newsletters. I have since unsubscribed from ~85% of them, but Axios remains as I appreciate their concise takes on a variety of topics. Bonus, they hit my Brave traffic since I need to pop them out of Gmail due to message length. ðŸ‘Œ

3.The Ringer. Time to admit my addiction to quippy pop culture writing. The 20th Anniversary of Office Space was [given its appropriate due](https://www.theringer.com/movies/2019/2/19/18228673/office-space-oral-history), this [sharp piece of analysis](https://www.theringer.com/movies/2019/2/28/18050196/american-history-x-basketball-scene-ed-norton) gave me a cringy flashback to both a period chalk full of adolescent fascinations I wouldn't mind forgetting, as well as a warm reminiscence of Edward Norton's [late](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0128442/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_41) [90's](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_38) ["peak"](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0171433/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_37). (SIDENOTE: Whatever happened to [Edward Furlong](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000411/?ref_=tt_cl_t2)? Oh, he's 41! Oh, alcoholism, heroin, domestic violence arrest... )

![We were so young, once...](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA5OTQwODkwMzleQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDUwOTM4MDMy._V1_SX1777_CR0,0,1777,736_AL_.jpg)

4.[Safiya Nygaard](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbAwSkqJ1W_Eg7wr3cp5BUA/videos). This chick's pretty funny. I was drawn in by her video about [wedding dresses from wish.com](https://youtu.be/mcZdTvOqmvI) (brilliant idea for a video), then spent some time looking through her other stuff. I'm not a huge video person but I found her charming. 

Note: Brave seems to weight youtube.com more heavily in ranking than text-based sites. Probably something about the "attention" score relating to video versus articles. This is something I'm considering for the future - may eliminate youtube placements due to that weighting which I feel is unfair. I spend a fraction of the time objectively on youtube versus other sites and yet it muscles up into the rankings regardless.

5.Ah, good ol New York Times. First of my forays into *gasp* Paid Journalism. Been a subscriber for years now. Flirt on and off with the crossword puzzle, but I consider it a news resource well worth the cost. 

This week the standout was [this piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/18/style/carol-gilligan.html?) about new work in feminist theory by women who would be considered "old guard" by the sprinting 3rd/4th wave. The theory seems interesting.

> Reprising midcentury studies of children separated from their caregivers and more recent studies of infants (most notably the Still Face experiment, a gruesome display of what happens when babiesâ€™ efforts to connect with their mothers are thwarted), Dr. Gilligan and Ms. Snider explore the aftermath of trauma and the loss of connection. They suggest that the stages of that rupture, as they put it, which psychologists have described as protest, despair and detachment, mirror what happens when young women and young men mature and begin to display stereotypical male and female behaviors: e.g. the detached, heroic male; the selfless, overly nurturing female. (Detachment derives from two attachment styles that are considered pathologies â€” avoidant-attachment and anxious-attachment â€” and itâ€™s from those respective affects, Dr. Gilligan and Ms. Snider suggest, that we get our cartoon male and female behaviors, in which intimacy suffers and emotion turns into playacting.)

As a scientific-leaning social-science-BA-holder, I like to see theory backed by research. I've shortlisted this book on my reading list. (Reading List Backup still ~10000 years or so).
